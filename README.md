# Hi, I'm Lalitha 👋

I'm a human simply trying to become a kinder version of myself every day, toward others and myself.

My digital journey began with a book blog on Instagram in 2021, connecting me to a world of stories, friendships, and creative collaborations. Since then, I've explored everything from freelance marketing to mental health advocacy, and now, I'm deep into tech and community building.

Currently, I'm pursuing a BS in Data Science at IIT Madras—a place that’s shown me the magic of diversity, creativity, and collective growth. I serve as a Notion Campus Leader, where I help hold space for different kinds of learners and foster compassionate teamwork.

## 💡 What I Value

* **Love, Courage & Honesty:** Kindness to myself and others, openness, and the courage to bridge differences.
* **Community:** Building inclusive spaces where people feel seen and heard.
* **Balance:** I believe in healthy work-life boundaries, even when “hustle culture” says otherwise.

## 🔬 Interdisciplinary Systems Research Lab

I lead a research lab focused on the intersection of human perception, systemic engineering, and AI-era competency. My work focuses on moving away from "machine-like" proxies toward systems that respect human dignity and cognitive load.

## 🛋️ Comfort Mode Toolkit

Maintainer of [Comfort Mode Toolkit](https://github.com/comfort-mode-toolkit)—an open-source initiative dedicated to building perceptually comfortable, inclusive, and customizable web experiences.

We focus on making tech spaces gentler, prioritizing accessibility, user autonomy, and well-being—especially for those who need a little extra comfort in digital environments.

## 📚 Projects & Open Source

* Explore [ideabank](https://github.com/lalithaar/ideabank)—a scratchbook of ideas, some just seeds, some more fleshed out.
If an idea sparks something in you, feel free to take it and run—no need for attribution. Build gently, rest well, and be kind to yourself. If your journey leads to kindness or joy, that’s more than enough.
Life’s most beautiful journeys are sometimes the quiet ones, shared with someone you love or simply with love.
* I’m always excited to contribute to open source projects that nurture inclusion, accessibility, and comfort.
